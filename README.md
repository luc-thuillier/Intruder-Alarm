This Arduino project creates an intruder alarm system using a photoresistor, multiple LEDs or RGB lights, a buzzer, a servo, and a button. When the photoresistor detects light, the LEDs or RGB lights flash, and the buzzer produces a custom siren sound. Simultaneously, the servo motor moves 180 degrees to simulate closing a panic room. If the button is pressed, the system deactivates the alarm with a 5-second delay and resets, preparing to detect intruders again after the delay. When no light is detected, the LEDs, servo, and buzzer remain off. The system repeats this cycle continuously. Functions are used to organize the code for easier debugging and readability.
